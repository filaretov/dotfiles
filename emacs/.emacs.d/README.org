* Preamble
  Thank you to everyone who has decided to share their own Emacs
  configuration with the world. I owe a lot to the learned yak shavers
  of this world.

  Special thanks to:
  - [[https://harryrschwartz.com/][Harry Schwartz]]

* Base
  This configuration assumes that =use-package= and =general= are
  always available and the preferred method of package and keybinding
  management. Also, as much as possible will be forced into
  =use-package= declarations.
