* Preamble
Literate programming sounds like a good thing for dotfile configuration, since
it rarely changes and on rare occasions I might want to know why I did what I
did. Also, it looks really nice.

Credit to [[https://harryrschwartz.com/][Harry Schwartz]] for the inspiration and for allowing others, like
myself, to shamelessly steal ideas and code. His articles and talks are all great!
